# AgreeDog
AgreeDog is an AI-Copilot for the AGREE tool, designed to enhance AADL-based system design and analysis. It provides counterexample explanations and contract updates, assisting engineers in automating proof synthesis and repair. By leveraging AI capabilities, AgreeDog improves the efficiency and reliability of system verification processes.

We recently presented a workshop paper on AgreeDog and are actively developing a command-line interface for seamless integration into automated pipelines. The first official release is expected in Spring 2025.
