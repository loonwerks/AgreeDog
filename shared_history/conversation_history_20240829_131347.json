Thus, you are a powerful AGREE copilot designed to assist users with AGREE for verifying their textual code for AADL models.      The user can input a snippet of code or a path to a file, which you can then open, read, and process using AGREE.      Additionally, you can:\n    1- Interpret AGREE's output directly from the user's input or from a log file specified by the path,     containing AGREE's results.\n    2- Provide code repairs in case AGREE identifies issues or fails the user can ask question like I have     the error message please provide code repair to resolve it, don't change the requirements unless asked by user    3- Generate and suggest assertions (these are called guarantees) upon request to help verify the code efficiently.\n    4- Assist in setting up preconditions, postconditions, and assumptions tailored to the user's needs, enhancing the    verification process. These are called \"Assume\" statements \\ \n    Your goal is to facilitate a smoother verification workflow, helping users to pinpoint and rectify vulnerabilities,    and ensure their code adheres to specified safety and correctness criteria (properties) . here is an example of code     that includes Assume and guarantee statements from the attachments. ### an example of how to use AGREE to verify ADDL model.Here's an example of how to use the Assume-Guarantee Reasoning Environment (AGREE) to verify an AADL model based on the provided documents.\n\n###Example: Verifying a Simple Unmanned Helicopter Component\n\n    Model the System in AADL:\n        Start by modeling the software architecture of an unmanned helicopter in AADL.

        "content": "The Assume-Guarantee Reasoning Environment (AGREE) is a formal verification tool that integrates with the Architecture Analysis & Design Language (AADL). AGREE is used to formally specify and verify properties of system models. It provides a framework for defining and checking assumptions and guarantees about system components, ensuring that the system behaves as expected under specified conditions.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of key concepts in AGREE:\n\n1. **Assumptions**: These are statements about the expected conditions or inputs to a component. They specify what the component assumes to be true about its environment or inputs.\n   \n2. **Guarantees**: These are assertions about the expected behavior or outputs of a component. They specify what the component guarantees to produce given that the assumptions hold.\n\n3. **Initial State**: This defines the initial conditions or state of the system or component.\n\n4. **Contracts**: AGREE uses assume-guarantee contracts to formally specify the behavior of components. A contract consists of assumptions and guarantees that describe the component's expected inputs and outputs.\n\n5. **Verification**: AGREE uses model checking techniques to verify that the assumptions lead to the guarantees under all possible conditions. If the verification is successful, it confirms that the component behaves as specified. If not, AGREE provides counterexamples to help debug and refine the model.\n\n### Example of AGREE in Use\n\nConsider a simple component of an unmanned helicopter that processes STANAG 4586 messages:\n\n```aadl\npackage UnmannedHelicopter\npublic\n\n\tsystem UnmannedHelicopterSystem\n\tend UnmannedHelicopterSystem;\n\n\tsystem implementation UnmannedHelicopterSystem.impl\n\tsubcomponents\n\t\tinput_component: system InputComponent.impl;\n\t\tfcc_component: system FCCComponent.impl;\n\tconnections\n\t\tconn: port input_component.message_out -> fcc_component.message_in;\n\tproperties\n\t\t-- Add system-level properties here\n\tend UnmannedHelicopterSystem.impl;\n\n\tsystem InputComponent\n\tfeatures\n\t\tmessage_in: in data port;\n\t\tmessage_out: out data port;\n\tannex agree {**\n\t\t-- Initial state\n\t\tinitially mode = NO_MODE;\n\t\t-- Assumptions\n\t\tassume \"Valid STANAG 4586 message\" :\n\t\t\t0 < auth_in.rloi and auth_in.rloi <= 5 and\n\t\t\t0 <= auth_in.csm and auth_in.csm <= 2 and\n\t\t\t0 < auth_in.cucsid and auth_in.cucsid < 255;\n\t\t-- Guarantees\n\t\tguarantee \"Vehicle starts in NO_MODE\":\n\t\t\t(mode = NO_MODE) -> true;\n\t\tguarantee \"Transition to MANUAL_WAYPOINT_MODE requires appropriate LOI\":\n\t\t\tmode != pre(mode) and mode = MANUAL_WAYPOINT_MODE => pre(current_loi) = 4;\n\t**};\n\tend InputComponent;\n\n\tsystem implementation InputComponent.impl\n\t\tproperties\n\t\t\t-- Add implementation-level properties here\n\tend InputComponent.impl;\n\nend UnmannedHelicopter;\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The **initially** statement sets the initial mode to `NO_MODE`.\n- The **assume** statement defines valid input conditions for STANAG 4586 messages.\n- The **guarantee** statements specify the expected behavior of the component:\n  - The vehicle starts in `NO_MODE`.\n  - Transition to `MANUAL_WAYPOINT_MODE` requires an appropriate level of interaction (LOI).\n\nAGREE helps ensure that these properties hold true, enhancing the reliability and correctness of the system model.\n\n### Steps to Use AGREE\n\n1. **Model the System in AADL**: Define the architecture and components of the system.\n2. **Create AGREE Contracts**: Specify assumptions and guarantees using AGREE annexes in AADL.\n3. **Use AGREE in OSATE**: Integrate AGREE with the OSATE tool to attach expressions and run verification.\n4. **Check Verification Results**: Analyze the results, debug counterexamples, and refine the model as necessary.\n\nAGREE is a powerful tool for formal verification in model-based development, providing confidence in the correctness and safety of system designs."
