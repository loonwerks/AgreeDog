Thus, you are a powerful AGREE copilot designed to assist users with AGREE for verifying their textual code for AADL models.      The user can input a snippet of code or a path to a file, which you can then open, read, and process using AGREE.      Additionally, you can:\n    1- Interpret AGREE's output directly from the user's input or from a log file specified by the path,     containing AGREE's results.\n    2- Provide code repairs in case AGREE identifies issues or fails the user can ask question like I have     the error message please provide code repair to resolve it, don't change the requirements unless asked by user    3- Generate and suggest assertions (these are called guarantees) upon request to help verify the code efficiently.\n    4- Assist in setting up preconditions, postconditions, and assumptions tailored to the user's needs, enhancing the    verification process. These are called \"Assume\" statements \\ \n    Your goal is to facilitate a smoother verification workflow, helping users to pinpoint and rectify vulnerabilities,    and ensure their code adheres to specified safety and correctness criteria (properties) . here is an example of code     that includes Assume and guarantee statements from the attachments. ### an example of how to use AGREE to verify ADDL model.Here's an example of how to use the Assume-Guarantee Reasoning Environment (AGREE) to verify an AADL model based on the provided documents.\n\n###Example: Verifying a Simple Unmanned Helicopter Component\n\n    Model the System in AADL:\n        Start by modeling the software architecture of an unmanned helicopter in AADL.

        "content": "AGREE, which stands for Assume-Guarantee Reasoning Environment, is a formal verification tool used in conjunction with AADL (Architecture Analysis & Design Language) to verify system models. It facilitates the verification of software and system architecture models by allowing users to define formal assumptions and guarantees about the system components and their interactions.\n\n### Key Features of AGREE:\n\n1. **Assume Statements**:\n   - These capture the assumptions about the environment or inputs to the system/component.\n   - Example:\n     ```aadl\n     assume \"Valid input range\" :\n       0 <= input_value and input_value <= 100;\n     ```\n\n2. **Guarantee Statements**:\n   - These specify the properties or behaviors that the system/component must exhibit, given that the assumptions hold true.\n   - Example:\n     ```aadl\n     guarantee \"Output within range\" :\n       output_value >= 0 and output_value <= 200;\n     ```\n\n3. **Initial Conditions (initially Statements)**:\n   - These define the initial state or condition of the system/component.\n   - Example:\n     ```aadl\n     initially mode = NO_MODE;\n     ```\n\n4. **Preconditions and Postconditions**:\n   - These allow for specifying conditions before and after certain transitions or events.\n   - Example:\n     ```aadl\n     guarantee \"Transition to MANUAL_WAYPOINT_MODE requires appropriate LOI\":\n       mode != pre(mode) and mode = MANUAL_WAYPOINT_MODE => pre(current_loi) = 4;\n     ```\n\n5. **Verification Process**:\n   - **Modeling:** Users model their systems and components using AADL.\n   - **Contract Definition:** Users define AGREE contracts using assumptions and guarantees within AGREE annexes in AADL.\n   - **Analysis:** Users run the AGREE analysis to check if the assumptions lead to the guarantees under all possible conditions.\n   - **Debugging:** If counterexamples are found, users can debug and refine their models and contracts.\n\n6. **Integration with OSATE**:\n   - AGREE is integrated with the Open Source AADL Tool Environment (OSATE), which provides a graphical interface for modeling and verification.\n\n### Example Workflow:\n\n1. **Model the System in AADL**:\n   - Define the system architecture and components.\n   ```aadl\n   system UnmannedHelicopterSystem\n   end UnmannedHelicopterSystem;\n\n   system implementation UnmannedHelicopterSystem.impl\n   subcomponents\n     input_component: system InputComponent.impl;\n     fcc_component: system FCCComponent.impl;\n   connections\n     conn: port input_component.message_out -> fcc_component.message_in;\n   properties\n     -- Add system-level properties here\n   end UnmannedHelicopterSystem.impl;\n   ```\n\n2. **Create AGREE Contracts**:\n   - Define assumptions and guarantees in AGREE annexes.\n   ```aadl\n   system InputComponent\n   features\n     message_in: in data port;\n     message_out: out data port;\n   annex agree {**\n     -- Initial state\n     initially mode = NO_MODE;\n\n     -- Assumptions\n     assume \"Valid STANAG 4586 message\" :\n       0 < auth_in.rloi and auth_in.rloi <= 5 and\n       0 <= auth_in.csm and auth_in.csm <= 2 and\n       0 < auth_in.cucsid and auth_in.cucsid < 255;\n\n     -- Guarantees\n     guarantee \"Vehicle starts in NO_MODE\":\n       (mode = NO_MODE) -> true;\n\n     guarantee \"Transition to MANUAL_WAYPOINT_MODE requires appropriate LOI\":\n       mode != pre(mode) and mode = MANUAL_WAYPOINT_MODE => pre(current_loi) = 4;\n   **};\n   end InputComponent;\n   ```\n\n3. **Run AGREE Analysis in OSATE**:\n   - Use the OSATE plugin to attach AGREE expressions and run the analysis.\n\n4. **Check Verification Results**:\n   - AGREE will confirm if the assumptions lead to the guarantees under all conditions.\n   - Debug and refine the model if necessary.\n\nAGREE helps ensure that the system architecture adheres to specified safety and correctness criteria by rigorously verifying the assumptions and guarantees defined for each component."
