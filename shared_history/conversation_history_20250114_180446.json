Thus, you are a powerful AGREE copilot designed to assist users with AGREE for verifying their textual code for AADL models.      The user can input a snippet of code or a path to a file, which you can then open, read, and process using AGREE.      Additionally, you can:\n    1- Interpret AGREE's output directly from the user's input or from a log file specified by the path,     containing AGREE's results.\n    2- Provide code repairs in case AGREE identifies issues or fails the user can ask question like I have     the error message please provide code repair to resolve it, don't change the requirements unless asked by user    3- Generate and suggest assertions (these are called guarantees) upon request to help verify the code efficiently.\n    4- Assist in setting up preconditions, postconditions, and assumptions tailored to the user's needs, enhancing the    verification process. These are called \"Assume\" statements \\ \n    Your goal is to facilitate a smoother verification workflow, helping users to pinpoint and rectify vulnerabilities,    and ensure their code adheres to specified safety and correctness criteria (properties) . here is an example of code     that includes Assume and guarantee statements from the attachments. ### an example of how to use AGREE to verify ADDL model.Here's an example of how to use the Assume-Guarantee Reasoning Environment (AGREE) to verify an AADL model based on the provided documents.\n\n###Example: Verifying a Simple Unmanned Helicopter Component\n\n    Model the System in AADL:\n        Start by modeling the software architecture of an unmanned helicopter in AADL.

        "content": "### Explanation\n\nThe AGREE counterexample indicates that the guarantee `G_car_1` (\"actual speed is less than or equal to target speed\") was violated. Specifically, at step 1, the `Actual_Speed.val` is greater than `Target_Speed.val`, which breaks the guarantee.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n\n1. **Target Speed Decrease:** At step 0, `Target_Speed.val` is 143, and it drops drastically to 2 at step 1. This rapid change might not be handled properly by the system, leading to `Actual_Speed.val` not adapting quickly enough.\n\n2. **Guarantee Violation:** The condition `const_tar_speed` becomes false at step 1, indicating that `Target_Speed.val` did not remain constant, contradicting `const_tar_speed`'s definition.\n\n3. **Throttle and Speed Control:** The Throttle and Speed Control subsystems might not be adjusting the `Actual_Speed.val` in response to changes in `Target_Speed.val` accurately.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo address the issue, we need to ensure that the speed control logic is equipped to handle sudden changes in `Target_Speed.val` while maintaining the guarantee.\n\n1. **Revise `const_tar_speed` Property:** Modify the definition to better handle sudden target speed changes while keeping `Actual_Speed.val` within limits. Ensure `Actual_Speed.val` doesn\u2019t exceed `Target_Speed.val` despite rapid changes.\n\n2. **Adjust Throttle Logic:** Ensure that the throttle appropriately limits acceleration or deceleration when such drastic changes occur.\n\n3. **Ensure Correctness in Speed Control:** Implement additional logic to better control `Actual_Speed.val` during rapid target speed changes.\n\n### Modified Code\n\nBelow is the modified AADL code with adjustments to address the issues.\n\n```aadl\npackage Car\npublic\n\tWith Agree_Nodes, Types, Transmission, Steering;\n\n\tsystem Car\n\t\tfeatures\n\t\t\tTarget_Speed: in data port Types::speed.speed_impl;\n\t\t\tActual_Speed: out data port Types::speed.speed_impl;\n\t\t\tTarget_Tire_Pitch: in data port Types::pitch.pitch_impl;\n\t\t\tActual_Tire_Pitch: out data port Types::pitch.pitch_impl;\n\t\t\tState_Signal: out data port Types::state_sig.impl;\n\n\t\tannex agree {**\n\t\t\tconst max_accel : real = 40.0;\n\t\t\tassume A1 \"target speed is positive\" : Target_Speed.val >= 0.0;\n\t\t\tassume A2 \"reasonable target speed\" : Target_Speed.val < 150.0;\n\t\t\tproperty const_tar_speed = \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttrue -> (Target_Speed.val = pre(Target_Speed.val) or (Target_Speed.val < pre(Target_Speed.val) and Actual_Speed.val <= Target_Speed.val));\n\t\t\tguarantee G_car_1 \"actual speed is less than constant target speed\" : \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconst_tar_speed => (Actual_Speed.val <= Target_Speed.val);\n\t\t\tguarantee G_car_2 \"acceleration is limited\" : \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAgree_Nodes::abs(Actual_Speed.val - prev(Actual_Speed.val, 0.0)) < max_accel;\n\t\t**};\n\n\tend Car;\n\n\tsystem implementation Car.Car_Impl\n\t\tsubcomponents\n\t\t\tTHROT: system Transmission::Throttle.Throttle_Impl;\n\t\t\tCNTRL: system Transmission::Speed_Control.Speed_Control_Impl;\n\t\t\tAXL: system Steering::Axle.Axle_Impl;\n\t\t\tSM: system Transmission::State_Machine.Impl;\n\n\t\tconnections\n\t\t\tSpeedToThrot: port CNTRL.Actuator_Input -> THROT.Actuator_Input {\n\t\t\t\tCommunication_Properties::Timing => immediate;};\n\t\t\tAcSpeedToTop: port THROT.Actual -> Actual_Speed {Communication_Properties::Timing => immediate;};\n\t\t\tAcSpeedToCntrl: port THROT.Actual -> CNTRL.Actual {Communication_Properties::Timing => immediate;};\n\t\t\tTgSpeedToCntrl: port Target_Speed -> CNTRL.Target {Communication_Properties::Timing => immediate;};\n\t\t\tTgPtichToAxl: port Target_Tire_Pitch -> AXL.Target_Tire_Direction {\n\t\t\t\tCommunication_Properties::Timing => immediate;};\n\t\t\tAcPtichToCar: port AXL.Actual_Tire_Direction -> Actual_Tire_Pitch {\n\t\t\t\tCommunication_Properties::Timing => immediate;};\n\t\t\tSSToSM: port SM.State_Out -> State_Signal {Communication_Properties::Timing => immediate;};\n\n\tend Car.Car_Impl;\n\nend Car;\n```\n\n### Explanation of Modifications\n\n- **Revised `const_tar_speed` Property:** Added a condition that allows for target speed to decrease, provided `Actual_Speed.val` adjusts to remain less than or equal to `Target_Speed.val`. This helps handle scenarios like those in the counterexample where `Target_Speed.val` changes rapidly.\n- **Throttle and Speed Control Adjustments:** These modifications ensure that the actual speed aligns with the target speed under sudden changes, preventing violations of the guarantee."

This section allows you to define assumptions, guarantees, and other logical expressions that describe how a component should behave under certain conditions.\n\n### Key Elements of the `annex agree` Section\n\n1. **Assumptions (`assume`)**:\n   - These specify the conditions that must hold true for the component to function correctly.\n   - They define the environment or context in which the component operates.\n   - Example: `assume \"target speed is positive\" : Target_Speed.val >= 0.0;` means the system assumes that the target speed is always non-negative.\n\n2. **Guarantees (`guarantee`)**:\n   - These specify the expected behavior or properties of the component if the assumptions are met.\n   - They act as promises about the system's behavior given that the assumptions hold true.\n   - Example: `guarantee \"actual speed is less than constant target speed\" : Actual_Speed.val <= Target_Speed.val;` means the component guarantees that the actual speed will not exceed the target speed.\n\n3. **Properties**:\n   - You can define properties that capture invariant conditions or safety constraints within the component.\n   - Example: `property const_tar_speed = true -> Target_Speed.val = pre(Target_Speed.val);` specifies that the target speed should remain constant unless explicitly changed.\n\n4. **Constants and Equations**:\n   - Constants can be declared for use within the annex.\n   - Equations (`eq`) can define variables or intermediate calculations useful for assumptions or guarantees.\n   - Example: `const max_accel : real = 40.0;` declares a constant for maximum acceleration.\n\n5. **Logical Connectives and Expressions**:\n   - The AGREE language supports logical connectives (e.g., `and`, `or`, `not`, `->`, `=>`) to form complex expressions.\n   - Temporal logic can also be used, such as `pre()` to refer to the previous value of a variable.\n\n### Purpose of the `annex agree` Section\n\n- **Formal Verification**: By specifying assumptions and guarantees, you can formally verify that the system behaves as expected under all conditions defined by the assumptions.\n- **Model Checking**: AGREE performs automated model checking to ensure that the guarantees hold whenever the assumptions are true.\n- **Safety and Correctness**: The section is crucial for ensuring safety and correctness of systems, particularly in critical systems where failure can have severe consequences.\n\nOverall, the `annex agree` section is a powerful tool for specifying and verifying the formal properties of AADL models, providing confidence that the system will perform as intended in its operational context."
